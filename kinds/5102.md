description: Job request to overlay two images.

# Input

Clients must provide exactly two `"i"` tags specifying the two images to overlay. The supported input types are:
- `"url"`
- `"job"` (content field must be a URL)

One of the `"i"` tags must specify the `"background"` [marker](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/90.md), which specifies that this input image is used as the  background image.

# Params

## `position`

Description:
Specifies the position of the "foreground" image relative to the origin point, using an `x:y` coordinate pair denominated in pixels. The origin point (0,0) is the top left corner of the "background" image. 

A higher value in the x-axis means more to the right. A higher value in the y-axis means more downward.  Only positive values are allowed.


Usage:
```
["param", "position", "x:y"]
```

Example: position the "foreground" image 50 pixels to the right of the origin, 25 pixels down from the origin.
```
["param", "position", "50:25"]
```


# Output
